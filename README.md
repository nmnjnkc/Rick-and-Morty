# Rick-and-Morty

Rick and Morty Web App

This web application was developed using HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript. The app displays the characters from the popular animated TV show "Rick and Morty" and uses data from the Rick and Morty API to gather character information.

The main goal of this project was to implement a pagination feature that allows users to efficiently browse and navigate through the large set of characters. The pagination is implemented using the latest technologies and best practices to ensure a seamless and intuitive user experience.
